 *     this structur will hold all the information in the bitmap header
 *     This block of bytes is at the start of the file and is used to identify
 *     the file. A typical application reads this block first to ensure that the
 *     file is actually a BMP file and that it is not damaged.

	 * This block of bytes tells the application detailed     *
	 * information about the image, which will be used to     *
	 * display the image on the screen.                       *

	 * he reason that there are different headers is that     *
	 * Microsoft extended the DIB format several times.       *
	 * The new extended headers can be used with some GDI     *
	 * functions instead of the older ones, providing more    *
	 * functionality.                                         *
	 * For compatibility reasons we will use the old DIB      *
	 * format that have 40 bytes                              *

// thx to this site : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24436515/programatically-making-an-bmp-image i was able to solve the problem
//where when my image created i can't open it the prob was the ppadding tht BMP file expected
